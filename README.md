# About 
The visualization is based on insurance charge data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance).

# Insights
Insurance costs in this dataset fall roughly into three tiers: low cost, mid cost, and high cost. Low tier consists of only non-smokers. Breaking the visualization down further shows high tier consists largely of smokers with high BMI, with no significant difference in cost caused by sex or number of children. If you want to lower insurance costs, this data suggests that reducing smoking is by far the best way to accomplish that.
